   PC PORT OF GD - GIF MANIPULATING MODULE

It is port of GD library to Borland C/C++ v3.1
(compiler for PC DOS/WINDOWS platform).
This library was developed by Thomas Boutell 
( boutell@netcom.com ) but rather for 32bit workstations
with old style C compilers.
I made only few changes for Borland 3.1 compilation,
and not tested the new code intensively.
However my simple program for image processing based on the
top of this library working properly in real (BCC) and
protected mode (DJGPP).

If you want, get it for all non-commercial purposes.
